        "review_text": "I recently purchased the WiFi Projector from this listing and, so far, I must say it's been a superb addition to our family movie nights. I was in the market for a budget-friendly projector that would offer good quality and a decent brightness level without breaking the bank - this one has more than delivered on that.\n\nFirst and foremost, the brightness on this projector is a standout feature. It's significantly brighter than other projectors I considered in a similar price range. The vividness and clarity make it an absolute joy to use in a dimly lit room. However, it's important to note that this isn't a high-end projector - if you're looking for cinema-level image quality, you might need to invest a little more. Yet, for a fun, family-oriented device to enjoy movies, this projector is a gem.\n\nAs for the quality, it's surprisingly good given the price point. The projected image is clear and color reproduction is quite decent. I would stress that it's necessary to have a good screen or a white wall to get the best results. It's an inexpensive option that offers a good balance between quality and price, perfect for those who are just venturing into the world of home projectors.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, I've mainly used the HDMI and USB ports to connect my devices. Both have worked flawlessly, with a seamless connection and no lag or interruption in video playback. While I haven't tried out the WiFi connectivity yet, it's a feature that could come in handy for those who prefer wireless streaming.\n\nThe build of the projector itself is sturdy and compact, easy to set up and use, which makes it ideal for those who aren't too tech-savvy. The included instructions were clear and made the setup process straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're seeking a budget-friendly projector that delivers good quality and brightness for your family movie nights, this one fits the bill nicely. It offers excellent value for the price and is a solid performer in its class. Just remember that it's not competing with top-tier projectors, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a fun, affordable home cinema experience.",

Little did I know, the perfect combination of festive cheer and technological marvel awaited me in the form of the NISOO Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth and the delightful holiday film \"Last Christmas.\"\n\nFrom the moment I unboxed the NISOO projector, I was impressed by its compact and lightweight design. Lighter and more compact than budget friendly projectors I've pitched in the past, it was effortlessly portable, allowing me to set up my own personal cinema anywhere in my home. Its sleek, minimalist aesthetic complemented my living room d\u00e9cor seamlessly, adding a touch of understated elegance to the ambiance.\n\nAs I connected the projector to my streaming device, I was immediately captivated by the stunning picture quality it produced. The impressively bright light source delivered a vibrant and crystal-clear image. The colors were rich and saturated, bringing the festive scenes of \"Last Christmas\" to life across my 100' movie screen.\n\nThe projector's HDMI compatibility ensured a seamless connection to my Fire stick, allowing me to enjoy the film without any hiccups or interruptions. The built-in WiFi and Bluetooth provider additional enhancements to the viewing experience. I could stream the movie wirelessly and connect to external speakers for an immersive audio experience, though I would still recommend an aux cord if you have one available.\n\nSpeaking of understand elegance, the real star of the show was undoubtedly the film \"Last Christmas\" itself. With its charming characters, heartwarming storyline, and a touch of holiday magic, it was the perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of the season. Emilia Clarke's portrayal of Kate, a troubled young woman struggling to find her place in the world, was both endearing and heartbreaking. Her journey of self-discovery, aided by the enigmatic Tom, played to perfection by Henry Golding, an actor even more handsome than the NISOO Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth, was a testament to the power of human connection and the transformative spirit of the holiday season.\n\nThe supporting cast, including Rob Delaney, Sue Perkins, and Patti LuPone, brought a unique blend of humor, warmth, and wisdom to the film. Their performances added depth and dimension to the story, creating a rich tapestry of characters that resonated with viewers of all ages.\n\nAs the credits rolled on \"Last Christmas,\" I felt a sense of contentment and gratitude wash over me. The film had successfully captured the essence of the season, reminding me of the importance of love, compassion, and the transformative power of human connection. And the NISOO Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth had played a pivotal role in enhancing the viewing experience, providing a cinematic haven in the comfort of my own home.\n\nIf you're looking for a heartwarming and technologically advanced way to experience the magic of the holiday season, I highly recommend the NISOO Projector with WiFi and Bluetooth and the film \"Last Christmas.\" They are a perfect combination of festive cheer and technological marvel that will undoubtedly leave you feeling uplifted and inspired.",

The ability to provide 1080p quality makes the movie / show appear very sharp without any distortion or blurriness. It was extremely easy to setup and once setup it comes with a remote control that allows you to adjust from anywhere within range.

        "review_text": "After several weekends of movie nights in my backyard, I feel confident in sharing my thoughts on the 2023 Upgrade 9500L Outdoor Projector. Setting it up was a breeze; the instructions were clear, and I had it connected to my phone via WiFi in no time. The Bluetooth feature was just as seamless, allowing me to enhance the audio with my external speakers effortlessly.\n\nThe picture quality is impressive for its price point. The 1080P resolution delivers clear and vibrant images, and the 9500 lumens of brightness make evening screenings a delight, even with some ambient light. The focus and keystone correction features are straightforward, allowing for a crisp image on my makeshift screen.\n\nThe built-in speakers are decent, but for the full cinematic experience, I recommend pairing it with a quality outdoor speaker system, especially if you're like me, who enjoys the rumble of bass during action scenes.\n\nIn terms of build, it feels sturdy and portable, though I wouldn't risk leaving it outside overnight. It's lightweight enough to move around but doesn't feel fragile. The design is sleek and modern, with intuitive controls on the projector itself and a handy remote control.\n\nOne of the standout features for me is the ability to synchronize my smartphone screen. It's incredibly convenient for streaming from apps that aren't natively supported by the projector's system. The WiFi connection has been stable, and I haven't experienced any lag or disconnection issues during streaming.\n\nI haven't had to worry about battery life since it's a plug-in model, which is perfect for my setup where I have easy access to an outdoor outlet. Power consumption seems efficient, as I haven't noticed any significant increase in my electricity bill.\n\nFinally, I haven't had the need to contact customer service, which in itself is a testament to the product's quality and user-friendliness. But I did register the product online and received a confirmation email promptly, which gives me confidence in their customer service responsiveness.\n\nFor the price, this projector has exceeded my expectations. It's a fantastic option for anyone looking to enjoy their favorite films under the stars. Whether it's a family night or a gathering of friends, this projector has definitely been the highlight of the evening.",

This is a real game changer. I am really very happy with this projector that is now sub $100.00 and works better that my last one and the price is less than a third of the cost.\n\nAll you need when you get this is a blank wall - or a screen - and some popcorn .. and you will be saying \" ITS MOVIE NIGHT\"\n\nConvenient WiFi Connection:\nConnecting devices to the WiFi projector has never been easier! The updated WiFi connection steps and improved speed make it a breeze. I can now enjoy seamless connectivity anytime, anywhere. This feature has truly made my life easier and happier.\n\nWide Compatibility and Application:\nEquipped with HDMI, VGA, AV, and USB interfaces, this projector offers incredible versatility.",

        "review_text": "I recently purchased the WiFi Projector from this listing and, so far, I must say it's been a superb addition to our family movie nights. I was in the market for a budget-friendly projector that would offer good quality and a decent brightness level without breaking the bank - this one has more than delivered on that.\n\nFirst and foremost, the brightness on this projector is a standout feature. It's significantly brighter than other projectors I considered in a similar price range. The vividness and clarity make it an absolute joy to use in a dimly lit room. However, it's important to note that this isn't a high-end projector - if you're looking for cinema-level image quality, you might need to invest a little more. Yet, for a fun, family-oriented device to enjoy movies, this projector is a gem.\n\nAs for the quality, it's surprisingly good given the price point. The projected image is clear and color reproduction is quite decent. I would stress that it's necessary to have a good screen or a white wall to get the best results. It's an inexpensive option that offers a good balance between quality and price, perfect for those who are just venturing into the world of home projectors.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, I've mainly used the HDMI and USB ports to connect my devices. Both have worked flawlessly, with a seamless connection and no lag or interruption in video playback. While I haven't tried out the WiFi connectivity yet, it's a feature that could come in handy for those who prefer wireless streaming.\n\nThe build of the projector itself is sturdy and compact, easy to set up and use, which makes it ideal for those who aren't too tech-savvy. The included instructions were clear and made the setup process straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're seeking a budget-friendly projector that delivers good quality and brightness for your family movie nights, this one fits the bill nicely. It offers excellent value for the price and is a solid performer in its class. Just remember that it's not competing with top-tier projectors, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a fun, affordable home cinema experience.",

Cables includes are HDMI, Audio, and power.\n\nThe projector is bright enough that you can see it in a dimly lit room, and quiet enough to not be annoying while watching something. It comes with a cleaning kit in case dust gets on the lens or inside the bulb housing.\n\nOverall this is a great projector for the money!",

It has all the same features as any past models, but updated (multiple input options depending on what devices you have available, plus they send you the coordinating cords!), and even has bluetooth capability to connect right to your phone or table or laptop to watch videos, Netflix, youtube, slideshows or even just screen-mirror!\n\nThe picture quality is great, and fully adjustable (height, focus, and tilt are all adjustments you can make) and the sound is clear and loud, but there is capability (bluetooth or cords) if you prefer to hook up to another bluetooth speaker/speaker.\n\nit comes with a big cloth screen, but it works great against a light colored wall or surface too. The remote makes every menu super simple to access and operate!\n\nAbsolutely buy this product over others out there - you won't be disappointed!",

Bluetooth connectivity worked just fine for my surround sound system. Did setup wifi was haven't made good use of that feature. Chromecast connected easily and observed little to no lag in audio/video. The brightness does appear to be just a little bit low. Would have liked it to be little more bright but I might have to upgrade maybe. With closed windows and lights, the quality is good. Remote control has low range. Need to be super close to the device to actually get the remote working so that is something that could be improved. Overall, lot of fun and great value for money. Definitely recommend as a starter to learn about projectors and understand what you like and want in a projector.",

        "review_text": "Play Video\n This was my first time buying a projector, all components as stated were packed safely in the box. The screen sheet I was especially impressed by, had no harsh wrinkles whatsoever, very smooth material. I would recommend an extension cord if your outlet is more than about about 75-80\u201d from where you\u2019d like the projector set up as that\u2019s the length of the projector cord at its longest when pulled tight (~80\u201d).\n\nOnce you\u2019ve plugged in the projector and set up your wifi password on the projector itself using the remote, you\u2019ll then want to connect your wireless device to connect wirelessly, which is my preference. There are connections and an HDMI cable included for hard wired connection (pictured). I tried set up with Android as that\u2019s my primary device, but as my phone model doesn\u2019t have the capability required (Multi-screen/Miracast option when scrolling down on the top, near where you\u2019d find the brightness) I ended up using my iOS device which worked very quickly and seamlessly. I just select iOS cast on the projection menu, tap screen mirroring on iOS device and select the projector device that\u2019s on my iOS device network and was connected. I added a screenshot if you\u2019re not connecting wirelessly that shows the other options available.\n\nThe screeen sheet has 6 grommets total, 4 in each corner and 1 in the middle along the top width and 1 in the middle along the bottom width. It comes with 6 hooks and 6 adhesive strips to set up. The adhesive strips are average, they could be stronger but it\u2019s not enough to remove a star. Just a suggestion to not provide too much tension between hooks as that\u2019ll cause the sheet to fall. Also to note with the remote it doesn\u2019t come with batteries, so you\u2019ll need 2 AAA.\n\nThere are 4 different projection modes, front, rear, front ceiling, rear ceiling, and depending on where you position it the image can be blurrier - but that\u2019s easily fixed on the projector itself by using the focusing element near the lens. Also it arrives with a lens cap and a cleaning kit with a cloth and such which is nice.\n\nI\u2019ve added a video of the projector in a room during daytime but I tried to get it the room as dark as possible, I was standing pretty much midway between the projector and the screen. The colors are much more vivid in person - the video doesn\u2019t do it justice, but you can get a feel for the sound quality which was emanating from the projector itself not my iOS device and it was pretty strong, hopefully I wasn\u2019t standing too close to distort it.\n\nThis is my first projector like I said so I\u2019ll keep playing around with it, maybe watching on the ceiling etc but so far I really like it and would definitely recommend.",

It's also much smaller and quieter than my old BenQ projector that was more than 10x the price of this one.\n\nI'm excited to have outdoor movie night again and play games on this.

It has all the same features as any past models, but updated (multiple input options depending on what devices you have available, plus they send you the coordinating cords!), and even has bluetooth capability to connect right to your phone or table or laptop to watch videos, Netflix, youtube, slideshows or even just screen-mirror!\n\nThe picture quality is great, and fully adjustable (height, focus, and tilt are all adjustments you can make) and the sound is clear and loud, but there is capability (bluetooth or cords) if you prefer to hook up to another bluetooth speaker/speaker.\n\nit comes with a big cloth screen, but it works great against a light colored wall or surface too. The remote makes every menu super simple to access and operate!\n\nAbsolutely buy this product over others out there - you won't be disappointed!",
